		The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme ('Scheme') is a hybrid accumulation-defined benefits scheme which provides benefits to its members under the Superannuation Act 1976
		(as subsequently amended). The Trustee of the Scheme is Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC) (ABN 48 882 817 243).
	</p>
	<p>
		Monies paid to the Trustee for the purposes of the Scheme are held in the CSS Fund. The CSS Fund comprises contributions made by members and employers, income arising from	
		investments, and unrealised and realised changes in market value of investments held within	the CSS Fund. The Trustee pays member benefits and taxes relating to the CSS Fund out of
		the CSS Fund. The Trustee pays the direct and incidental costs of management of the CSS	Fund and the investment of its money from the assets of the ARIA Investments Trust that are
		referable to the CSS Fund (Note 6(c)).
	</p>
	<p>
		Administration of member records, contributions receipts and benefit payments was historically conducted on behalf of the Trustee by ComSuper. Following the passage of the 
		<em>Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Legislation Amendment Bill 2015</em> on 15 June 2015, ComSuper was merged into CSC on 1 July 2015. CSC continues to 
		be the trustee of the public sector and defence force superannuation schemes and now also performs the scheme administration activities formerly undertaken by ComSuper.
	</p>
	<p>
		The principal place of business and registered office of the Trustee is Level 8, 121 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2601.
