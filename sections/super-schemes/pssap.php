                PSSap is a public sector scheme established on 1 July 2005 by the PSSap Act. It is an accumulation plan. Members and employers pay money into the Fund, with investment returns calculated as a compound average rate of return after fees and taxes have been deducted. PSSap is open to eligible employees of participating employers under choice of fund legislation. Employers contribute 15.4% per annum on behalf of their employees.
            </p>
            <p>
                PSSap also offers an Ancillary membership to eligible CSS and PSS members to make additional super contributions and transfers, and an account-based pension product known as CSCri (Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation retirement income) to eligible public sector scheme members.
            </p>

                PSSap contributors can make before and after- tax voluntary contributions.

            <h3>Ancillary contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Ancillary contributions can be made by contributing CSS and PSS members who also join PSSap to build a separate superannuation benefit. Their benefit in PSSap has unit prices applied in line with the investment returns of the Fund and does not impact their CSS or PSS benefit in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ancillary memberships have been available since 1 July 2013. In 2015–16, almost $87 million in Ancillary contributions (in the form of salary sacrifice, personal (after tax) contributions, spouse contributions, and super transfers) were made (compared to $54 million in 2014–15).
            </p>
            <h3>Employer contributions</h3>
            <p>
                PSSap contributors receive 15.4% employer contributions.

            <p>
                The two most common reasons why superannuation benefits are paid out of the PSSap Fund are for the purpose of retirement and to consolidate funds into another super fund.

            <h3>Insurance benefits</h3>
            <p>
                During 2015–16, eligible PSSap members received an automatic level of death, total and permanent disability (TPD) and income protection cover, and could apply to vary, increase, decrease or opt out of their cover. These insurance arrangements are detailed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1 October 2016, new insurance arrangements (called life<em>PLUS</em> cover) will be introduced, making the insurance cover offered through PSSap available to eligible PSSap preserved and Ancillary members for the first time. life<em>PLUS</em> cover has two offerings: life<em>PLUS</em> auto cover and life<em>PLUS</em> choice cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                All insurance cover for PSSap members (including life<em>PLUS</em> cover) that is detailed in this report is provided by the Insurer, AIA Australia Limited ABN 79 004 837 861, AFSL 230043).
            </p>
            <h3>Death and TPD</h3>
            <p>
                During 2015–16, cover provided a lump sum payment on death or TPD. The level of cover changed automatically based on a member’s age, unless the member had fixed cover in place, which remained the same until the cover ceased or until the member advised that they wish to opt out of that level of cover.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members could choose death and TPD cover or death only cover.
