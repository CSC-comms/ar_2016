			This Annual Performance Statement is prepared for section 39(1) of the PGPA Act. In the opinion of the directors of CSC, the performance statement accurately presents CSC’s performance for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 and complies with subsection 39(2) of the PGPA Act.

	<h2>CSC’s purpose</h2>

			CSC’s purpose is to grow the wealth of Australian Government employees and members of the Australian Defence Force for their retirement as the trustee of the Australian Government’s public sector and military superannuation schemes.

			In CSC’s 2015–16 PGPA Corporate Plan and in the 2015–16 Portfolio Budget Statements, CSC’s two stated Outcomes were:

	<h2>Analysis of performance against purpose</h2>
		<h4>Superannuation scheme governance</h4>
			<p>
				CSC’s investment return target for the rolling three-year period to 30 June 2016 was achieved despite lower returns in 2015–16 compared to the three previous straight years of very strong net returns. Performance in the financial year to 30 June 2016 was constrained by subdued returns from global equity markets and cash, which were only partially offset by solid returns from property and most fixed interest markets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Financial market performance throughout 2015–16 was quite volatile. This reflected an environment which was characterised by concerns over a slowdown in economic growth, particularly in China, a significant decline in commodity prices, particularly in oil, and the UK’s decision to exit from the European Union at the end of the year. In response, global central banks maintained very accommodative monetary policies, which helped to buoy the return from fixed interest markets.
			</p>
			<p>
				Further analysis of CSC’s investment performance is provided in the Chair’s report on pages 14–17. Information on CSC’s investment approach, strategy and governance is provided in the Investment section of this report on pages 37–44.
			</p>
			<p>
				All CSC’s compliance, RSE and AFS Licence holder obligations were met in 2015–16 including obtaining the regulatory approvals, systems and processes required to open CSC’s two new military superannuation schemes, ADF Super and ADF Cover, on 1 July 2016. Information on CSC’s governance approach is provided in the Governance section of this report on pages 33–35.
			</p>
		<h4>Superannuation administration services</h4>
			<p>
				Member satisfaction with CSC’s super services was high in 2015–16, in particular for members who called our Customer Information Centre to receive general advice, attended a CSC seminar or webinar to learn more about their scheme, or obtained personal financial advice from an Industry Fund Services (IFS) financial planner. Members reported, on average, a high level of satisfaction with the quality of the service provided to them and a high level of satisfaction with the improvement in their knowledge as a result of the service provided to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				More information about CSC’s superannuation services is provided on pages 47–48, including information on the ‘fee for service’ financial advice available to CSC members through CSC’s partnership with IFS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Administration service standards were also maintained to a high level in 2015–16, with the most challenging area of work continuing to be the area of invalidity casework and reconsiderations for CSC’s military schemes.
			</p>
			<p>
				CSC’s pension payment target was not achieved because of an error by CSC’s bank resulting in 1% of pension payments due on 9 July 2015 not being received in pensioners’ bank accounts until the next day.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bank acknowledged its responsibility for the error, offered its apologies to CSC, and processes were reviewed to minimise any risk of a recurrence. CSC’s ability to meet this performance target is partly subject to the performance of CSC’s bank and pensioners’ banks, and a very small number of payments will always be rejected (eg due to changes in bank accounts not communicated to CSC).
			</p>
			<p>
				Further information on the administration of CSC’s super schemes, including the service standards set for and achieved during 2015–16, is provided in the Super Schemes section of this report on pages 45–63.
