                    CSC’s schemes generally consist of two types of members: contributors, who are employed by a participating scheme employer (usually an Australian Government entity) or are members of the ADF; and deferred benefit members or preservers who do not contribute to their scheme because they no longer work for a participating employer or are no longer ADF members. These members maintain an account within their scheme and under scheme rules can generally become contributors again if they join a participating employer or rejoin the ADF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pensioners are former scheme members who have exited their scheme and receive a pension paid by the Australian Government. Eligible pensioners from the military schemes may become contributors again if they re-enter the ADF for a period of more than 12 months.

                    Public sector scheme members who join CSCri are referred to as CSCri members.

                    Depending on scheme rules, scheme membership may also include former spouses following a family law split, who are known as associates; spouses and eligible children of deceased pensioners or members; and members who under scheme rules hold a benefit in a second scheme (MilitarySuper or PSSap), who are known in their second scheme as Ancillary members.
