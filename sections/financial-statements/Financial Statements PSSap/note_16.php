					<h2>Financial instruments management</h2>
						<p>
							A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
						</p>
						<p>
							The investments of the Plan (other than cash held for managing contribution receipts, insurance expenses, benefit payments and tax payments) comprise units in the ARIA 
							Investments Trust ('AIT'). AIT is a pooled superannuation trust which is also governed by the Trustee. This type of investment has been determined by the Trustee to be 
							appropriate for the Plan and is in accordance with the Plan's published investment strategy. The Trustee applies strategies to manage risk relating to the investment 
							activities of the AIT. The investments of AIT are managed on behalf of the Trustee by specialist sector fund managers who are required to invest the assets in accordance 
							with contractual investment mandates.
						</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Significant accounting policies</h2>
					<p>
						Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and 
						expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Capital risk management</h2>
					<p>
						The RSE licence of the Trustee of the Plan requires the Trustee to maintain a balance of at least $100 000 at all times in an administration reserve account in the AIT. 
						This is required to be maintained in cash or cash equivalents. The Trustee of the Plan was in compliance with this requirement throughout the year.
					</p>					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Categories of financial instruments</h2>
					<p>
						The financial assets and liabilities of the Plan are recognised at net market value as at the reporting date. Net market value approximates fair value less costs of 
						realisation of investments. The cost of realisation of investments is minimal and therefore net market value, which is the carrying value, approximates fair value. 
						Changes in net market value are recognised in the Operating Statement.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Financial risk management objectives</h2>
					<p>
						The Plan is exposed to a variety of financial risks as a result of its pooled investments in the AIT. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value 
						interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Plan's risk management and investment policies, approved by the Trustee,
						seek to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the Plan's financial performance. These policies may include the use of financial derivative instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee ensures that there is an effective risk management control framework in place for the Plan. Consistent with regulatory requirements, the Trustee has developed, 
						implemented and maintains a Risk Management Framework to identify the policies, procedures, processes and controls that comprise its risk management and control systems 
						for the Plan and for the Plan's investments through the AIT. The overall investment strategy of the Plan is set out in the Trustee's approved investment policies which 
						address the investment strategy and objectives and risk mitigation strategies including risk mitigation relating to the use of derivatives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee's internal investment team monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Plan's investments. Derivative Risk Statements set out the strict parameters 
						for the Trustee's investment managers authorised to use derivatives. In essence, derivatives cannot be used to raise the level of risk above the level it would otherwise 
						have been, and derivatives cannot be used to leverage the investments.
					</p>
					<p>	
						The Plan's investments are managed on behalf of the Trustee by specialist external investment managers who invest their respective fund allocation in accordance with the 
						terms of a written investment mandate or disclosure document. The Trustee has determined that the appointment of these managers is appropriate for the Plan and is in 
						accordance with its investment strategy.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Credit risk</h2>
					<p>
						Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Plan. In its capacity as trustee of AIT, 
						the Trustee has adopted a policy of spreading the aggregate value of transactions across approved creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of 
						financial loss. The Plan's exposure to its counterparties are continuously monitored by the Trustee.
					</p>
					<p>
						The largest exposure to a single counterparty is to cash held by the investment master custodian Northern Trust. Credit risk relating to the master custodian is mitigated 
						through contract indemnity provisions. Other than the master custodian, no individual exposure within AIT exceeded 5% of net assets of that trust at 30 June 2016 or 30 
						June 2015.
					</p>
					<p>
						The credit risk on the Plan's directly held cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable is limited because the counterparty is the Reserve Bank of Australia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table below shows the maximum exposure of financial assets to credit risk at the reporting date:

						There has been no change to the Plan's exposure to credit risk or the manner in which it manages and measures that risk during the reporting period.
					</p>					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Liquidity risk</h2>
					<p>
						Liquidity risk is the risk that the Plan will encounter difficulty in either realising assets or otherwise raising sufficient funds to meet its financial liabilities 
						and/or member benefit payments or tax liabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that the Plan will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities and member withdrawals. The Plan 
						allows members to withdraw benefits, and it is therefore exposed to the liquidity risk of meeting member withdrawals at any time. The Plan has a high level of net inward 
						cash flows through new contributions which provide capacity to manage liquidity risk. The Trustee undertakes forecasting and scenario testing of the cashflow requirements 
						of the Plan to ensure timely access to sufficient cash and holds actively-traded, highly-liquid investments to meet anticipated funding requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a further risk mitigation strategy, it is the Trustee's policy that the target asset allocation to illiquid assets is limited to around 25% of the investments of the AIT 
						(with a plus or minus 10 percentage point rebalancing range around that target). Regular scenario testing is performed to confirm the validity of the strategy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Plan’s financial liabilities. Vested benefits have been included in the less than three months column, as this is 
						the amount that members could call upon as at reporting date. This is the earliest date on which the Plan can be required to pay members’ vested benefits. However, 
						members may not necessarily call upon amounts vested to them during this time. The tables have been drawn up based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial 
						liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Plan can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.

						There has been no change to the Plan's exposure to liquidity risk or the management and measurement of that risk during the reporting period.
					</p>					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Market risk</h2>
					<p>
						Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three 
						types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other market price risk. The policies and procedures put in place to mitigate the exposure to market risk are 
						detailed in the Trustee's investment policies and the Risk Management Framework.
					</p>
					<p>
						There has been no change to the Plan's exposure to market risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk since the 2015 reporting period.
					</p>
					<h3>Foreign currency risk</h3>
					<p>
						Foreign currency risk is the risk that the net market value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Plan does not undertake any transactions in foreign currency and is therefore not directly exposed to foreign currency risk. However, the Plan is indirectly exposed to 
						foreign currency risk from the international assets held in the AIT, and it is managed in accordance with the Trustee’s approved investment strategy. The AIT enters into 
						forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge into Australian dollars some of the currency exposure arising from its investments denominated in developed markets foreign 
						currencies. These contracts neutralise some of the gains and losses from currency fluctuation. A small part of the investments of AIT, relating to emerging markets, may 
						remain unhedged due to lack of suitable currency instruments for hedging.
					</p>
					<h3>Interest rate risk</h3>
					<p>
						Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Plan is directly exposed to interest rate risk on cash and cash equivalents held with the Reserve Bank of Australia to meet benefits, taxation and insurance payments. 
						All holdings at 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 had a maturity profile of less than one month.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Plan is indirectly exposed to interest rate risk through its investments in AIT. The Trustee manages interest rate risk through its investment strategy including 
						diversification of asset allocation and the use of a diversity of specialist investment sector managers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following table illustrates the Fund's sensitivity to a 0.3% p.a. (2015: 0.4%) increase or decrease in interest rates, based on cash balances directly held at 
						reporting date. This represents an assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Had interest rates been lower or higher by 0.3% (2015: 0.4%) at reporting 
						date, and all other variables were held constant, the financial result would have improved / (deteriorated) as demonstrated:

					<p>
						In the Trustee's opinion, the sensitivity analysis at reporting date approximates the direct interest rate exposures of the Plan during the financial year.
					</p>
					<h3>Other price risk</h3>
					<p>
						Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Plan's investment in AIT is exposed to market price risk in respect of the latter's holdings of equity securities and unit trusts. As the investment in AIT is carried at net market value with changes in net market value recognised in the Operating Statement, all changes in market conditions will directly affect the Plan's net investment income. In its capacity as trustee of AIT, the Trustee manages the market price risk arising from these investments by diversifying the portfolio in accordance with its investment strategy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following table illustrates the Plan's sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the value of its investment in AIT, based on risk exposures at reporting date. The volatility factors represent the average annual historical volatility in the investment option unit prices. For the Cash Option and the investments backing the operational risk reserve a factor of 0.3% (2015: 0.4%) has been applied representing a reasonably possible change in interest rates as a proxy for price risk of the option. Had the unit price been higher or lower by the volatility factor at the reporting date, and all other variables were held constant, the financial result would have improved/ (deteriorated) as follows:

					<h2>Fair value measurements</h2>
					<p>
						The Plan's financial instruments are included in the Statement of Financial Position at net market value that approximates fair value. The net market value is determined per accounting policies in Note 3(a).
					</p>
					<h3>Net market value measurements recognised in the Statement of Financial Position</h3>
					<p>
						The following table provides an analysis of the Plan's financial instruments whereby the assets and liabilities are each grouped into one of three categories based on the degree to which their method of valuation is observable.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Level 1</strong>: net market value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Level 2</strong>: net market value measurements are those derived from inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) that are observable such as prices or derived from prices.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Level 3</strong>: net market value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data.
