					<h2>Financial instruments management</h2>
						<p>
							A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
						</p>
						<p>
							The investments of the Scheme (other than cash held for managing contribution receipts, benefit payments and tax payments) comprise units in the ARIA Investments 
							Trust ('AIT'). AIT is a pooled superannuation trust which is also governed by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation as Trustee. This type of investment has 
							been determined by the Trustee to be appropriate for the Scheme and is in accordance with the Scheme's published investment strategy. The Trustee applies strategies 
							to manage the risk relating to the investment activities of AIT. The investments of AIT are managed on behalf of the Trustee by specialist sector fund managers who 
							are required to invest the assets in accordance with contractual investment mandates.
						</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Significant accounting policies</h2>
					<p>
						Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and 
						expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset and financial liability are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Capital risk management</h2>
					<p>
						The RSE licence of the Trustee of the Scheme requires the Trustee to maintain a balance of at least $100 000 at all times in an administration reserve account in the AIT. 
						This is required to be maintained in cash or cash equivalents. The Trustee of the Scheme was in compliance with this requirement throughout the year.
					</p>					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Categories of financial instruments</h2>
					<p>
						The financial assets and liabilities of the Fund are recognised at net market value as at the reporting date. Net market value approximates fair value less costs of 
						realisation of investments. The cost of realisation of investments is minimal and therefore net market value, which is the carrying value, approximates fair value. 
						Changes in net market value are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Financial risk management objectives</h2>
					<p>
						The Fund is exposed to a variety of financial risks as a result of its pooled investment in the AIT. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair 
						value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Fund's risk management and investment policies, approved 
						by the Trustee, seek to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the Fund’s financial performance. These policies may include the use of financial 
						derivative instruments.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee is responsible for ensuring that there is an effective risk management control framework in place for the Fund. Consistent with regulatory requirements, the 
						Trustee has developed, implemented and maintains a Risk Management Framework to identify the policies, procedures, processes and controls that comprise its risk 
						management and control systems for the Fund and for the Fund's investments through the AIT. The overall investment strategy of the Fund is set out in the Trustee's 
						approved investment policies which address the investment strategy and objectives and risk mitigation strategies including risk mitigation relating to the use of derivatives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee's internal investment team monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Fund's investments. Derivative Risk Statements set out the strict 
						parameters for the Trustee's investment managers authorised to use derivatives. In essence, derivatives cannot be used to raise the level of risk above the level it 
						would otherwise have been, and derivatives cannot be used to leverage the investments.
					</p>
					<p>	
						The Fund's investments are managed on behalf of the Trustee by specialist external investment managers who invest their respective fund allocation in accordance with the 
						terms of a written investment mandate or disclosure document. The Trustee has determined that the appointment of these managers is appropriate for the Fund and is in 
						accordance with its investment strategy.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Credit risk</h2>
					<p>
						Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Scheme. In its capacity as trustee of AIT, 
						the Trustee has adopted a policy of spreading the aggregate value of transactions across approved creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of 
						financial loss. The Fund's exposure to its counterparties are continuously monitored by the Trustee.
					</p>
					<p>
						The largest exposure to a single counterparty is to cash held by the investment master custodian Northern Trust. Credit risk relating to the master custodian is mitigated 
						through contract indemnity provisions. Other than the master custodian, no individual exposure within AIT exceeded 5% of net assets of that trust at 30 June 2016 or 
						30 June 2015.
					</p>
					<p>
						The credit risk on the Fund's directly held cash and cash equivalents and interest receivable is limited because the counterparty is the Reserve Bank of Australia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The table below shows the maximum exposure of financial assets to credit risk at the reporting date:

						There has been no change to the Fund's exposure to credit risk or the manner in which it manages and measures that risk during the reporting period.
					</p>					
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Liquidity risk</h2>
					<p>
						Liquidity risk is the risk that the Scheme will encounter difficulty in either realising assets or otherwise raising sufficient funds to meet its financial liabilities 
						and/or member benefit payments or tax liabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that the Fund will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as they fall due. On resignation 
						the member benefit accrued before 30 June 1999 can be paid as a lump sum but the balance must be preserved until the member’s preservation age, either in the Fund or 
						another complying superannuation fund. The employer benefit, including productivity component, must be preserved in the Fund. The unfunded component of benefit payments 
						is financed by the Commonwealth, from the CRF. As such there is minimal liquidity risk.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Fund's exposure to liquidity risk is therefore limited to those circumstances in which the Scheme Rules allow members to withdraw benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Trustee undertakes forecasting and scenario testing of the cashflow requirements of the Fund to ensure timely access to sufficient cash and holds actively-traded, 
						highly-liquid investments to meet anticipated funding requirements. As a further risk mitigation strategy, it is the Trustee's policy that the target asset allocation 
						to illiquid assets is limited to around 25% of the investments of the AIT (with a plus or minus 10 percentage point rebalancing range around that target). Regular 
						scenario testing is performed to confirm the validity of the strategy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Fund’s financial liabilities. Vested benefits have been included in the less than three months column, as 
						this is the amount that members could call upon as at reporting date. This is the earliest date on which the Fund can be required to pay members’ vested benefits. 
						However, members may not necessarily call upon amounts vested to them during this time. The tables have been drawn up based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows 
						of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Fund can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.

					</p>					
				</li>

					<h2>Market risk</h2>
					<p>
						Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three 
						types of risk: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and other market price risk. The policies and procedures put in place to mitigate the exposure to market risk are 
						detailed in the Trustee's investment policies and the Risk Management Framework.
					</p>
					<p>
						There has been no change to the Fund's exposure to market risk or the manner in which it manages and measures that risk since the 2015 reporting period.
					</p>
					<h3>Foreign currency risk</h3>
					<p>
						Foreign currency risk is the risk that the net market value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Fund does not undertake any transactions in foreign currency and is therefore not directly exposed to foreign currency risk. However, the Fund is indirectly exposed 
						to foreign currency risk from the international assets held in the AIT, and it is managed in accordance with the Trustee’s approved investment strategy. The AIT enters into 
						forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge into Australian dollars some of the currency exposure arising from its investments denominated in developed markets foreign 
						currencies. These contracts neutralise some of the gains and losses from currency fluctuation. A small part of the investments of the AIT, relating to emerging markets, may 
						remain unhedged due to lack of suitable currency instruments for hedging.
					</p>
					<h3>Interest rate risk</h3>
					<p>
						Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Fund is directly exposed to interest rate risk on cash and cash equivalents held with the Reserve Bank of Australia to meet benefits and taxation payments. All 
						holdings at 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 had a maturity profile of less than one month.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Fund is indirectly exposed to interest rate risk through its investments in AIT. The Trustee manages interest rate risk through its investment strategy including 
						diversification of asset allocation and the use of a diversity of specialist investment sector managers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following table illustrates the Fund's sensitivity to a 0.3% p.a. (2015: 0.4%) increase or decrease in interest rates, based on cash balances directly held at 
						reporting date. This represents an assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Had interest rates been lower or higher by 0.3% (2015: 0.4%) at reporting 
						date, and all other variables were held constant, the financial result would have improved / (deteriorated) as demonstrated:

					<p>
						In the Trustee's opinion, the sensitivity analysis at reporting date approximates the direct interest rate exposures of the Fund during the financial year.
					</p>
					<h3>Other price risk</h3>
					<p>
						Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those 
						arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all similar 
						financial instruments traded in the market. Other price risk The Fund's investment in AIT is exposed to market price risk in respect of the latter's holdings of 
						equity securities and unit trusts. As the investment in AIT is carried at net market value with changes in net market value recognised in the Statement of Changes in 
						Net Assets, all changes in market conditions will directly affect the Fund's net investment income.
					</p>
					<p>
						In its capacity as trustee of AIT, the Trustee manages the market price risk arising from these investments by diversifying the portfolio in accordance with its 
						investment strategy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following table illustrates the Fund's sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the value of its investment in AIT, based on risk exposures at reporting date. 
						The volatility factors shown represent the average annual volatility of comparable option prices expected for the Fund's investment in the ARIA Investments Trust. For the 
						Cash Option and the investments backing the operational risk reserve, a factor of 0.3% (2015: 0.4%) has been applied representing a reasonably possible change in 
						interest rates as a proxy for price risk of the option. Had the unit price been higher or lower by the volatility factor at reporting date, and all other variables 
						were held constant, the financial result would have improved/(deteriorated) as follows:
