	<h2>Investment performance</h2>
	<p>
		Investment performance for each option is calculated after fees and taxes. Performance is calculated based on the actual value of investment option assets as at the end of the quoted performance period (which is 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 for this report) and is indicative only of the performance that a member achieves on their investment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following performance figures are based on final valuations as at 30 June 2016. Past performance is no indication of future performance.
	</p>
	<p>
		Earning rates (for CSS and PSS) and unit prices (for MilitarySuper, PSSap and CSCri) are needed for daily member transactions and will determine the actual performance a member achieves based on the timing of their individual transactions. The earning rates and unit prices are determined based on the best available information at the time they are declared. Valuations are fed into the calculations for earning rates and unit prices as soon as practical after they are received.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using earning rates or unit prices to calculate an investment performance figure for the 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016 period will provide similar but not identical rates to the investment performance figures published below.
	</p>
	<p>
		Analysis of CSC’s investment performance is included in the <strong>Chair’s report</strong> on pages 14–17 and in the <strong>Annual Performance Statement</strong> on pages 18–20. </p>
