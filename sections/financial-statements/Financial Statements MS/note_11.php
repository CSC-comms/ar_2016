				Vested benefits are benefits which are not conditional upon continued membership of the Scheme (or any other factor other than resignation from the Scheme) and include benefits 
				which members were entitled to receive had they terminated their Scheme membership as at the reporting date.
			</p>
			<p>
				The actuarial estimate of vested benefits at 30 June 2016 is $36.3 billion (2015: $33.1 billion). The value of vested benefits represents the liability that would have fallen 
				on the Scheme if all members had ceased service on 30 June 2016 and elected the option which maximised their benefit entitlement.
			</p>
			<p>
				The vested benefits have been calculated on the basis of current legislative arrangements for indexation of pension payments.
