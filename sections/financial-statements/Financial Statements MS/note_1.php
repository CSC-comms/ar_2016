	<p>
		The Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme ('Scheme') (ABN 50 925 523 120) is a hybrid accumulation-defined benefits scheme which provides benefits to its members under 
		the <em>Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991</em>. The Trustee of the Scheme is Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC) (ABN 48 880 817 243).
	</p>
	<p>
		The Scheme is operated for the purpose of providing members of the Australian Defence Force (and their dependants or beneficiaries) with lump sum and pension benefits upon 
		retirement, termination of service, death or disablement. For the purposes of the Scheme, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Fund No. 1 (Fund) accepts employer contributions 
		from the Department of Defence, other government contributions, membersâ€™ contributions, transfers from other superannuation funds, and contributions made by members for the 
		benefit of their spouse.
	</p>
	<p>
		Administration of member records, contributions receipts and benefit payments were historically conducted on behalf of the Trustee by ComSuper. Following the passage of the 
		<em>Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Legislation Amendment Bill 2015</em> on 15 June 2015, ComSuper was merged into CSC on 1 July 2015. CSC continues to be the 
		trustee of the public sector and defence force superannuation schemes and now also performs the scheme administration activities formerly undertaken by ComSuper.
	</p>
	<p>
		The principal place of business and registered office of the Trustee is Level 8, 121 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2601.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Scheme was closed to new members from 30 June 2016 and a new accumulation plan, Australian Defence Force (ADF) Super was established for new members of the Australian 
		Defence Force from 1 July 2016, together with a new invalidity scheme, ADF Cover.
