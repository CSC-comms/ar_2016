				In the normal course of business, requests are made by members and former members for the review of decisions relating to benefit entitlements of the Plan (including insurance benefits) which could result in additional benefits becoming payable in the future. Each request is considered on its merits prior to any benefit becoming payable. In the opinion of the Trustee, these requests do not represent a material liability on the Plan.
