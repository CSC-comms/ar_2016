	<h2>Accounting Policy</h2>
	<h3>Revenue from rendering of services</h3>
		<p>
			CSC receives scheme administration fees collected from employers participating in PSS and CSS, and from members of PSSap, and through negotiated administration charges collected from the Department of Defence. Additional funding may be provided by Government to meet specific administration requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
			Revenue is recognised to the extent that is it probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue can be reliably measured. Where revenue is received but not earned, it is shown as the liability 'unearned revenue'. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date for the purpose of revenue recognition is determined by reference to:
		</p>
		<ol class="lower_alpha">
			<li>services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed; or</li>
			<li>the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Receivables for goods and services, which have 30 day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due less any impairment allowance account. Collectability of debts is reviewed at end of the reporting period. Allowances are made when collectability of the debt is no longer probable.
