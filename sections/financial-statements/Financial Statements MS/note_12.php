				The amount of accrued benefits is the present value of expected future benefit payments that arise from membership of the Scheme up to the measurement date. The accrued 
				benefits are comprised of a funded component (i.e. accumulated member contributions, and, where applicable, productivity contributions, plus interest) which will be met 
				from the Fund, and an unfunded component that, pursuant to the <em>Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991</em>, will be funded from the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the 
				time the superannuation benefits become payable.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of accrued benefits in respect of the Scheme is calculated on a triennial basis. The most recent valuation of the accrued benefits was undertaken by the Australian 
				Government Actuary as part of a comprehensive review as at 30 June 2014. A summary of the review is attached.
