            <h2>Overview of CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS is a public sector scheme established on 1 July 1976 by the CSS Act. It closed to new members on 30 June 1990. CSS is a hybrid scheme (part accumulation and defined benefit) where benefits derive from a member and employer component.
            </p>
            <p>
                The member component is the accumulation part. It consists of member contributions and Fund earnings. The employer component is the defined benefit part. It comprises two parts; the first is unfunded and generally paid as a lifetime non-commutable indexed pension (lifetime pensions are paid by the Australian Government). The second part is the employer productivity contributions, made-up of contributions and Fund earnings.
            </p>

            and orphan children may be paid under one account).</p>

            <h3>Member contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Contributors can make basic and supplementary contributions, both of which are made from after-tax income. Contributors can also make voluntary payments into PSSap (refer to the PSSap part for details).

            <h3>Employer contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Employers pay a fortnightly contribution, which is the productivity component. It is based on the member’s super salary.

            <h4>Pensions and lump sums</h4>
            <p>
                Benefits in CSS are paid in most cases when a member exits the scheme at retirement. Generally benefits cannot be paid until minimum retirement age is reached. Pensions are generally paid to former scheme members who have exited CSS. Pension payments are paid by the Australian Government.

            <h3>Death and invalidity</h3>
            <p>
                CSS provides partial invalidity, full invalidity and death benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benefits are based on the entitlement the individual member would have received if they had worked to their maximum retirement age (generally age 65), subject to any pre-existing medical conditions being assessed.

            <h2>Scheme legislation changes</h2>
            <p>
            The <em>Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2015</em> made consequential amendments to the <em>Superannuation Act 1976</em> as a result of changes made to the <em>Legislative Instruments Act 2003</em> including the renaming of that Act to the <em>Legislation Act 2003</em>. The <em>Statute Law Revision Act (No.2) 2015</em> made changes to the <em>Superannuation Act 1976</em> to modernise the language used in describing the CPI indexation arrangements.
