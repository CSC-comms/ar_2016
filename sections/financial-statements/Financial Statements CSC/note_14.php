            <h2>Fair Value</h2>
		<p>
			The following tables provide an analysis of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The remaining assets and liabilities disclosed in the Statement of Financial Position do not apply the fair value hierarchy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The different levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below:
		</p>
		<p>
			Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at measurement date.
		</p>
		<p>
			Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
		</p>
	<h3>Accounting Policy</h3>
		<p>
			Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not differ materially from the assets’ fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets.
		</p>
		<p>
			An independent valuer conducted revaluations of all leasehold improvements and property, plant and equipment as at 30 June 2016.

			<li>There were no changes in valuation technique used from previous years.</li>
			<li>CSC's assets are held for operational purposes and are not held for the purposes of deriving a profit. The current use of all-non financial assets is considered their highest and best use.</li>
			<li>The remaining assets and liabilities reported by CSC are not measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position.</li>
			<li>CSC did not measure any non-financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis as at 30 June 2016.</li>
			<li>There have been no transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the hierarchy during the year.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Significant level 3 inputs utilised by CSC have been derived and evaluated as follows:
		</p>
		<h4>Consumed economic benefit/obsolescence of asset</h4>
		<p>
			Assets that do not transact with enough frequency or transparency to develop objective opinions of value from observable market evidence have been measured utilising the cost (depreciated replacement cost (DRC)) approach. Under the DRC approach the estimated cost to replace the asset is calculated and then adjusted to take into account its consumed economic benefit/asset obsolescence (accumulated depreciation). Consumed economic benefit/asset obsolescence has been determined based on professional judgement regarding physical, economic and external obsolescence factors relevant to the asset under consideration.
