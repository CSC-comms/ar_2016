		The Public Sector Superannuation Scheme ('Scheme') is a defined benefit scheme which provides benefits to its members under the <em>Superannuation Act 1990</em> (as amended) and is 
		administered in accordance with a Trust Deed dated 21 June 1990 (as amended). The Trustee of the Scheme is Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC) (ABN 48 882 817 243).
	</p>
	<p>
		Monies paid to the Trustee for the purposes of the Scheme are held in the PSS Fund. The PSS Fund comprises contributions made by members and employers, income arising from investments, 
		and unrealised and realised changes in market value of investments held within the PSS Fund. The Trustee pays member benefits and taxes relating to the PSS Fund out of the PSS Fund. The 
		Trustee pays the direct and incidental costs of management of the PSS Fund and the investment of its money from the assets of the ARIA Investments Trust that are referable to the PSS 
		Fund (Note 6(c)).
	</p>
	<p>
		Administration of member records, contributions receipts and benefit payments was historically conducted on behalf of the Trustee by ComSuper. Following the passage of the 
		<em>Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Legislation Amendment Bill 2015</em> on 15 June 2015, ComSuper was merged into CSC on 1 July 2015. CSC continues to be the 
		trustee of the public sector and defence force superannuation schemes and now also performs the scheme administration activities formerly undertaken by ComSuper.
	</p>
	<p>
		The principal place of business and registered office of the Trustee is Level 8, 121 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2601.
