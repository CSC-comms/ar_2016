				<h2>Contributions</h2>
					<h3>Member Contributions</h3>
						<p>
							Members contribute to the Scheme at optional rates from 5% of salary, or they may opt to make nil contributions. The contribution rates were the same in the prior year.
						</p>
					<h3>Employer Contributions</h3>
						<p>
							Employers who do not operate their own productivity schemes contribute employer(productivity) contributions to the Scheme on a sliding scale averaging 3% of salaries paid 
							to members. The contribution rates were the same in the prior year.
						</p>
					<h3>Transferring Superannuation Benefits From Other Funds</h3>
						<p>
							Money invested in other superannuation funds can be transferred to the Scheme.
						</p>
					<h3>Government Co-Contributions</h3>
						<p>
							For the financial years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015, the Commonwealth Government contributed $0.50 for every $1.00 of eligible personal after-tax member 
							contributions paid to the Scheme up to a maximum of $500 per member.
						</p>
					<h3>Low Income Superannuation Contributions</h3>
						<p>
							The low income super contribution (LISC) is a Commonwealth Government superannuation payment of up to $500 for the financial years 2012-13 to 2016-17. LISC 
							payments are recognised as revenue when received.
						</p>

				<h2>Benefits</h2>
					<p>
						Where a benefit that becomes payable in respect of a member can be fully met from Scheme assets attributable to that member, the benefit is paid to the beneficiary from 
						the CSS Fund. Where a benefit becomes payable that cannot be fully met from Scheme assets attributable to the member, all moneys held in the CSS Fund in respect of the 
						member are paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the Commonwealth Government then assumes responsibility for funding the benefit.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of the total benefits payable at 30 June 2016, $0.103 million (2015: $0.216 million) is payable by the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Commonwealth Government is the 
						corresponding debtor for this amount in accordance with the funding arrangements described above.
					</p>
					<p>
						Benefits paid and payable by the CSS Fund and the Consolidated Revenue Fund during the year are as follows:

				<h2>Costs of Managing, Investing and Administering the Scheme</h2>
					<p>
						Costs of and incidental to the management of the Scheme and the investment of its money are charged against the assets of ARIA Investments Trust ('AIT') that are referable 
						to the Scheme. Transactions in respect of these costs have been brought to account in the financial statements of AIT.
					</p>
					<p>
						The costs of member administration were met by ComSuper until 30 June 2015. Following the passage of the Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes 
						Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 on 15 June 2015, ComSuper was merged into CSC on 1 July 2015. From this date, the costs of member administration are being met by CSC. 
						CSC continues to be the trustee of the Scheme and now also performs the scheme administration activities formerly undertaken by ComSuper.
					</p>
					<p>
						Expenses met by the AIT and referable to the Scheme are as follows:
