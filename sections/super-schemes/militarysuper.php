                MilitarySuper was established on 1 October 1991 by the MilitarySuper Act. MilitarySuper closed to new ADF entrants on 30 June 2016. ADF Super is now available to new ADF entrants. MilitarySuper members may choose to move to ADF Super or remain in MilitarySuper.
            </p>
            <p>
                MilitarySuper is a hybrid scheme (part accumulation and defined benefit). Benefits derive from a member and employer component. The member component is the accumulation part. It consists of member contributions, any amounts notionally brought over from DFRDB, plus Fund earnings on those amounts. The employer component is the defined benefit part. It is based on a member’s period of membership and final average salary. It is unfunded except for the portion relating to the employer 3% productivity contributions paid each fortnight to the Fund by the Department of Defence. Unfunded benefits are paid by the Australian Government.
            </p>
            <p>
                MilitarySuper offers an Ancillary membership to eligible DFRDB members and their spouses who wish to make additional contributions and transfers.

            <h3>Member contributions</h3>
            <p>
                The basic contribution rate is 5% of salary, including higher duties and the qualification and skills element of certain environmental allowances. Members can contribute up to 10% of their superannuation salary. Ancillary contributions are also accepted into the Fund from members, including both pre and post-tax contributions such as additional personal, salary sacrifice and spouse contributions.

            <h3>Ancillary contributions</h3>
            <p>
                Ancillary contributions can be made by contributing MilitarySuper and DFRDB members to build a separate superannuation benefit called an Ancillary benefit. It accrues as a separate accumulation interest, which has Fund earnings applied in line with the relevant investment returns. Ancillary contributions do not impact the member’s employer benefit in MilitarySuper or DFRDB.

            <p>
                Members who exit the scheme are entitled to receive a member-financed benefit regardless of their reason for leaving the ADF. Exiting members are also entitled to an employer-financed benefit, the amount of which varies based on the reason for their scheme exit. The employer-financed benefit is generally preserved until the member reaches their minimum preservation age.

            <h3>Death and invalidity</h3>
            <p>
                MilitarySuper provides partial invalidity, full invalidity and death benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a member becomes disabled and unable to continue their ADF service, invalidity benefits can help them to resettle into civilian employment.

            <h4>Invalidity classifications</h4>
            <p>
                There are three levels of invalidity classifications:
            </p>
            <ul>
            
                <li>Class A: Significant incapacity,</li>
                <li>Class B: Moderate incapacity,</li>
                <li>Class C: Low incapacity (no entitlement to an invalidity pension).</li>

            <p>
                Members classified Class A or Class B are not guaranteed an invalidity benefit for their lifetime and may be subject to periodic medical reviews by CSC or its delegate until the member reaches age 55. Members can also initiate a classification level review.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members classified Class C at retirement are not subject to periodic reviews but can request the initial classification be reconsidered. Their request must be made within 30 days of when the initial classification was determined.

            <h2>Scheme legislation &amp; trust deed changes</h2>
            <p>
                The <em>Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991</em> was amended to close the scheme to new members and adjust the process for re-entering members from 1 July 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>Acts and Instruments (Framework Reform) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2015</em> amended the <em>Military Superannuation and Benefit Act 1991</em> to update references to the Legislative Instruments Act to the <em>Legislation Act 2003</em>. These amendments commenced on 5 March 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Trust Deed to the Act was amended to facilitate the introduction of ADF Super and to make some minor administrative amendments. These took effect from September 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Trust Deed to the Act was further amended to ensure that ADF members must retire before receiving their benefit, rather than being treated as a ‘preserved member’ on the basis they had transferred to ADF Super. This took effect from 1 July 2016.
            </p>
