		Part of CSC’s mission is to achieve consistent long-term returns within a structured risk framework. To achieve this, CSC manages and invests each Fund so as to achieve its stated investment objective, having regard to strictly-defined risk limits. Each Fund is also managed in a way that allows for the payment of monies to meet scheme member benefit payments, achieves equity among all members, and exercises reasonable care and prudence to maintain and grow the Funds.
	</p>
	<p>
		CSC jointly invests the Funds in one pooled investment trust, providing economies of scale benefits to members in each regulated scheme.
	</p>
	<p>
		Investment options in each Fund gain exposure to various asset classes, and professional external investment managers are responsible for the management of the investments.
	</p>
	<p>
		A target asset allocation and asset allocation ranges are set for each investment option.
