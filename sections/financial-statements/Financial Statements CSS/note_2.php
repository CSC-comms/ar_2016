				<h2>Statement of Compliance</h2>
				<p>
					The financial report of the Scheme is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards and Interpretations and the 
					<em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</em>. Accounting Standards include Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') to the extent 
					that they are not inconsistent with AAS 25 <em>'Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans'</em>. For the purposes of preparing financial statements, the Scheme is a not-for-profit entity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The financial statements have been prepared on the basis required by the Defined Benefit Plan provisions of AAS 25, which provides specific measurement requirements for assets, 
					liabilities and for accrued benefits. A Defined Benefit Plan refers to a superannuation plan where the amounts to be paid to members on retirement are determined at least in part by a 
					formula based on years of membership and salary levels. The Trustee adopted the provisions of AAS 25 whereby the financial statements include a Statement of Net Assets, a Statement of 
					Changes in Net Assets and notes thereto.
				</p>
				<p>
					The form of these financial statements has been agreed by the Minister for Finance and the Trustee in accordance with sub-section 30(1)(d) of the Governance of Australian 
					Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011.
				</p>
				<p>
					Australian Accounting Standards require disclosure of Australian Accounting Standards that have not been applied for Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective. The 
					Trustee expects to adopt the Standards disclosed below upon their application date to the extent that they are not inconsistent with AAS 25 'Financial Reporting by Superannuation 
					Plans' (noting however that AASB 1056 'Superannuation Entities' replaces AAS 25 'Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans' ).
				</p>
				<p>
					<u>AASB 1056 <em>'Superannuation Entities'</em></u>
				</p>
				<p>
					AASB 1056 <em>'Superannuation Entities'</em> was issued on 5 June 2014. It replaces AAS 25 'Financial Reporting by Superannuation Plans' with effect for annual reporting periods 
					beginning on or after 1 July 2016 but can be applied earlier. The Trustee has elected not to early adopt AASB 1056 <em>'Superannuation Entities'</em>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Preparation of five primary financial statements (rather than the current two), being:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Statement of Financial Position;
							</li>
							<li>
								Income Statement;
							</li>
							<li>
								Statement of Changes in Equity/Reserves;
							</li>
							<li>
								Statement of Cash Flows; and
							</li>
							<li>
								Statement of Changes in Member Benefits.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The recognition of member benefits as a liability on the face of the Statement of Financial Position measured at each reporting date. As disclosed in Note 14, the 
							liability for accrued member benefits at 30 June 2014 (being the date of the most recent valuation by Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd) was $67.0 billion.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The recognition of an ‘employer sponsor receivable’ to recognise the Commonwealth Government’s legislated obligation under the <em>Superannuation Act 1976</em> (as amended) to 
							meet the shortfall between the liability for accrued benefits and the fair value of the net assets available to meet that liability. Based on the fair value of net 
							assets at 30 June 2016 and the most recent valuation of member benefits liabilities (as referred to above), the employer sponsor receivable at 30 June 2016 
							would be $63.7 billion.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Additional disclosures on estimates, disaggregated information, financial risk management and policies for managing defined benefit liabilities.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					AASB 1056 requires the measurement approach of ‘fair value through profit or loss’ for all assets and liabilities, except for specific exemptions including member benefits, tax 
					assets and liabilities and employer sponsor receivables. The investments of the Scheme are currently already measured at redemption price at the close of business on the last 
					business day of the reporting period and therefore this change in measurement approach will have no impact on the valuation of the Scheme’s investments. The Standard also requires 
					that where the Scheme has an obligation under insurance arrangements provided to members, any insurance contract liabilities are to be measured in a manner consistent with the way 
					in which defined benefit member liabilities are measured.
				</p>
				<p><u>Other Standards in issue but not effective</u></p>
				<p>
					In addition to AASB 1056 'Superannuation Entities' , the following Standards were in issue but not yet effective at the date of authorisation of the financial report. It is 
					anticipated that the adoption of the Standards disclosed below will not have a material financial impact on the financial report of the Scheme:

				<p>
					The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements. The adoption has not had any significant impact on the disclosures or

				<h2>Functional and presentation currency</h2>
					<p>
						The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency of the Scheme.
					</p>
					<p>
						Amounts in these financial statements have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
					</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Use of judgements and estimates</h2>
					<p>
						In the application of Accounting Standards, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
						readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
						under the circumstance, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
					</p>
					<p>
						The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the 
						revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
					</p>
					<p>
						Judgements made by management in the application of Accounting Standards that have significant effects on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of 
						material adjustments in the next year are disclosed, where applicable, in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
