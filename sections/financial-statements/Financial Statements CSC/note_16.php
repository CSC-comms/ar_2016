			Following the passage of the <em>Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Legislation Amendment Bill 2015</em> on 15 June 2015, ComSuper was merged into the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC) on 1 July 2015. As a result of the merger, the Statutory Agency of ComSuper was abolished, and as at 1 July 2015, the assets and liabilities ceased to be assets and liabilities of ComSuper, and became assets and liabilities of CSC without any conveyance, transfer or assignment. CSC was the successor in law in relation to the assets and liabilities.|

			In respect of functions assumed, the net book values of assets and liabilities transferred to CSC for no consideration and recognised as at the date of transfer were:

				<sup>1</sup> Accounting standards require CSC to take on ComSuper’s assets and liabilities at their 1 July 2015 fair value. During the course of the 2015-16 financial year, CSC identified that adjustments were required to the 30 June 2015 carrying values of ComSuper’s assets and liabilities so that they correctly represented their fair values. As such, ComSuper's 30 June 2015 asset and liability values have been adjusted for amounts identified relating to the independent valuation of fixed assets, the carrying amount (and related impairment) of intangible assets and the timing of asset purchases finalised prior to the restructure.
