	<p>
		CSC is responsible for ensuring that member Funds are not exposed to undue risk because of poor governance. We actively pursue principles of good governance in our own operations and seek them in the companies in which we invest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Poor environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance in an investment can indicate poor corporate management and may lead to a decline in investment value. CSC has implemented a number of investment governance practices, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>casting proxy votes in Australian and international companies in which we invest</li>
		<li>publicly communicating our ESG policy and practices</li>
		<li>governance research and engagement through Regnan, which provides governance research and engagement services to CSC and its other institutional investors.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)</h2>
	<p>
		CSC is a founding signatory of the United Nations supported Principles for Responsible Investment, which provides a framework for institutional investors to align investment activities with the broader interests of society while maximising long-term returns for their beneficiaries.
	</p>
	<p>
		The six Principles are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes.</li>
		<li>We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices.</li>
		<li>We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest.</li>
		<li>We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry.</li>
		<li>We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles.</li>
		<li>We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Montreal Carbon Pledge</h2>
	<p>
		CSC is also a signatory to the PRI Montreal Carbon Pledge which aims to increase investor awareness, understanding and management of climate change-related impacts, risks and opportunities. We commit to measuring and disclosing, on at least an annual basis, the carbon footprint of our public market equities portfolio.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the table below indicates, CSC’s public market equities portfolio’s carbon footprint (as at 30 June 2016) is estimated to be lower than its benchmark by 4 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per AUD million invested.
