		PSS is a public sector scheme established on 1 July 1990 by the PSS Act. It closed to new members on 30 June 2005. PSS is a defined benefit scheme where benefits generally derive from a member and employer component.
	</p>
	<p>
		The member component consists of member contributions and Fund earnings. The employer components comprise two parts; the first being employer productivity contributions plus Fund earnings, with the second part being the unfunded ‘benefit balance’, which is determined at the time a member exits relevant public sector employment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Members on retirement can convert 50% or more of their final benefit to a lifetime non-commutable indexed pension paid by the Australian Government.
	</p>

	<h2>Administration of PSS</h2>
	<h3>Member contributions</h3>
	<p>
		Contributors can contribute up to 10% of their salary for super purposes. Contributions are made from after-tax income. Contributors can also make voluntary payments into PSSap (refer to the PSSap section for details).

	<h3>Employer contributions</h3>
	<p>

	<h3>Benefit payments</h3>
	<h4>Pensions and lump sums</h4>
	<p>
		Benefits in PSS are paid in most cases when a member exits the scheme at retirement. Generally benefits cannot be paid until minimum retirement age is reached. Pensions are generally paid to former scheme members who have exited PSS. Pension payments are paid by the Australian Government.

	<h4>Death and invalidity</h4>
	<p>
		PSS provides partial invalidity, full invalidity and death benefits, and contributors can purchase additional death and invalidity cover, subject to those members meeting underwriting requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		Benefits are based on the entitlement the individual member would have received if they had worked to age 60, subject to any pre-existing medical conditions being assessed. Benefits for contributors after reaching age 60 are based on the age retirement pension that would have been payable to them.
